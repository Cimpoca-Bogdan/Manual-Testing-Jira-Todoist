    <h1>Testing Project for <b>Todoist</b></h1>
    <p>The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throughout the course and apply them in practice, using a live application.</p>
    
    <p><b>Application under test:</b> app.todoist.com</p>
    <p><b>Tools used:</b> Jira, Zephyr Squad.</p>

    <h2>Functional specifications:</h2>
    <p>The below stories (<b>Story 1: Create a New Task, Story 2: Mark a Task as Completed, Story 3: Recurring Tasks</b>) were created in Jira and describe the functional specifications of the <b>"Task Management"</b> module, for which the final project is performed upon.</p>
    <p><b>Insert here the screenshot of your Jira stories or download the file with all stories if you have more than two.</b></p>
    <p>Here you can find the release that was created for this project:</p>
    <p><b>Insert here a screenshot of the release created in Jira (including epic, stories, tasks, subtasks, and bugs).</b></p>

    <h2>Testing process</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Test planning</h3>
    <p>The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for all the modules from the Todoist application.</p>
    <p>The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan. The test plan that was created for this project can be found here <b>(insert link to the test plan document).</b></p>

    <h4>1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Project Manager</li>
        <li>Product Owner</li>
        <li>Software Developer</li>
        <li>QA Engineer (Your Name)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>1.1.2 Entry criteria defined</h4>
    <p>List all the entry criteria you defined for your project.</p>

    <h4>1.1.3 Exit criteria defined</h4>
    <p>List all the exit criteria you defined for your project.</p>

    <h4>1.1.4 Test scope</h4>
    <h5>Tests in scope:</h5>
    <p>Describe all the tests you plan to perform, including application functionalities, testing types or techniques, and devices on which you will test.</p>
    
    <h5>Tests not in scope:</h5>
    <p>Describe all the tests you do not plan or cannot perform. Include application functionalities, testing types, or devices excluded from the scope.</p>

    <h4>1.1.5 Risks detected</h4>
    <h5>Project risks:</h5>
    <p>List all project risks identified for your project.</p>

    <h5>Product risks:</h5>
    <p>List all product risks identified for your project.</p>

    <h4>1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria</h4>
    <p>The entry criteria defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Test Monitoring and Control</h3>
    <p>Explain the reason for the monitoring and control phase and how this phase was conducted. Also, insert the status report (test status report) from Zephyr Squad that reflects the activity and evolution of testing.</p>
    
    <h3>1.3 Test Analysis</h3>
    <p>The testing process will be executed based on the application requirements. <b>(The requirements analysis has been done to implement the <i>early testing</i> test principle. The results can be found here - insert the link to the review document.)</b></p>
    <p>The following test conditions were found:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Condition 1</li>
        <li>Condition 2</li>
        <li>Condition 3</li>
        <!-- Add all test conditions -->
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4 Test Design</h3>
    <p>Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad based on the analysis of the specifications. The test cases can be accessed here <b>(insert link to the test case file).</b></p>

    <h3>1.5 Test Implementation</h3>
    <p>The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>List of required elements</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.6 Test Execution</h3>
    <p>Test cases are executed on the created test cycle summary: <b>(insert the name of the test cycle).</b></p>
    <p>Bugs were created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found here: <b>(insert file with identified bugs).</b></p>
    <p>The following is a summary of the bugs that have been found:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bug 1: Priority - High, Severity - Critical</li>
        <li>Bug 2: Priority - Medium, Severity - Moderate</li>
        <!-- Add other bugs -->
    </ul>
    <p>Full regression testing is needed on the impacted areas after the bugs are fixed, and retesting will be done for every functionality that previously failed.</p>

    <h3>1.7 Test Completion</h3>
    <p>As the Exit criteria were met and satisfied as mentioned in the appropriate section, this feature is suggested to ‘Go Live’ by the Testing team.</p>
    <p>The traceability matrix was generated and can be found here: <b>(insert a screenshot or link to the traceability matrix).</b></p>
    <p>Test execution chart was generated and can be found below:</
